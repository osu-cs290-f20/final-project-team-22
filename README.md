Project Description:
OSU Tutors is a web application that provides Oregon State University students with access to quality tutors! 

Remote learning is the new normal and many students are struggling to learn in this new environment.

Whether you are struggling to understand a course topic or would like a qualified peer review on an essay, we can connect you with the right resources for your success!

You must login to be able to see our collection of tutors as well as add new tutors to our database!

Each tutor has their own profile page that is dynamically generated with their data.

Reviews can be added for each tutor and they have an overall quality rating based on the average of all of their reviews.
